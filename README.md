# ChatBox
This is a prototype Android app aimed at teaching conversation skills to autistic children. This was produced as part of my MSc in IT at the University of York (2018).

I have a list of things that need improving, mainly around the UI (especially for configuring conversations). I also intend to produce further templates to make the app more engaging.
